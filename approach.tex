\section{The Approach}

\subsection{The Methodology}

The method section displays how the research method used was co-design. Participants were recruited by Word of Mouth, online advertisement boards, libraries and senior citizen centres to partake in an advertised ``Design study for Smart Home Tech'' in exchange for monetary compensation. 

A pre-screening was conducted where participants were grouped based on the authors measurement of experience with smart home devices; this was based on whether they had used, planned to use or never used a smart home device.

Two sessions were conducted. The first focused on understanding the smart home privacy perception in a group-based discussion. The second focused on co-designing and prototyping a solution to these perceptions through co-creation amongst others in the group of experientially-similar peers. 

Following the conclusion of these sessions the data was analysed. A transcription of the recorded audio from the sessions was conducted. This transcript was read by multiple people then codified in a collaborative joint session at sentence level. 

The code was then supplemented individually and compared for potential differences using the Kappa measurement. 

Each code entry was then codified into a theme with cross-examination to ensure there was an agreement as to each categorisation.

The image data from the produced sketches was codified using Poole's methodology. Co-authors coded elements in every design. 
Codes drawn from these sketches were then also added to the existing themes with the Kappa analysis applied to ensure consistency. 

\subsection{Methodology Suitability}

The authors noted that they omitted the word privacy from the advertisement to ensure there was no bias.

Using word of mouth as a recruitment could face likely introduce of bias as these may be people of close contact with the authors and thus potentially share the same views or same level of understanding. This bias however may be outweighed by that of including other sources.

Some questions asked within the session are noted as being potentially leading; however, the authors note that this is intentional and is further balanced with another question.

The selection of a sample appears to omit the potential to consider stakeholders other than a specific age group of users above 18 years of age. This is of interest, despite the potential ethical implications of surveying minors, as the background identifies these as a key party involved in the aforementioned for Smart Home Privacy issues.

The selection sample in itself appears to be rather small, and the authors do identify that further studies on a larger scale could aid this study.

When separating the selection sample into experience levels, approaching this based on whether the participant is a current user, is aiming to use or has never used a smart home device is likely to yield inconsistent results. Not all those who are users hold equal levels of understanding of what they may be using; from the same angle non-users could be more experts than those who use them. The authors do however allude to a need for potential pre-survey education to normalise any issues around preconceptions.

The choice of a lo-fi versus a high-fi approach, whilst likely to hide further implications and feasibility matters, could questionably enable more expressive non-expert designs for those involved.

\subsection{Assumptions}

The study's result was the categorisation of design, interview transcriptions and notes into themes. The creation of these relies on a large assumption that these are truly representative of motifs within the broader Privacy and Smart Home Domains. 

There is a suggestion that the produced codes were given a measured considered examination to be applied to the correct theme, but there is little understanding of how this was done.

\subsection{Applied Rigour}

There is a constant evaluation of the suitability of the method applied. There is ample discussion into situations where bias may occur and the actions taken to mitigate the effect of these. For example, the authors expose a potential leading question in their initial session however show that the effects have been considered and mitigated through a balancing subsequent question. 

There is a discussion regarding limitations of the sample used. No participants in the sub-18 category were recruited despite related work identifying significant interest in this area. The sample size was also significantly small at only 25. The authors reveal that there was no focus on the wider stakeholder group and the focus was solely on the end user. 

They also show that the focus on a lo-fi approach could have restrained and limited concerns for feasibility and other further implications.
